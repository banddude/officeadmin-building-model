# Electrical PDF importer

The electrical PDF lane lives in `oabm.importers.pdf_electrical`. It recognizes
electrical meaning from a PDF and emits only canonical `oabm.model` v1 objects.

## Scope

This lane owns recognition of:

- distribution equipment such as panelboards, switchboards, and transformers
- field devices such as EVSE, receptacles, junction boxes, luminaires, switches, and disconnects
- form-XObject and annotation symbol observations
- electrical text, notes, circuit callouts, voltage, poles, phase, mounting heights, and host hints
- source provenance, confidence, stable source-derived IDs, and explicit unresolved evidence

It does not create architectural walls, rooms, levels, routes, quantities, IFC,
or drawing views. Final level, space, and physical host attachment belongs to the
PDF convergence gate.

## Spatial semantics before convergence

The canonical v1 model permits only one coordinate frame per document, so the
importer never places unrelated page-local coordinate systems into the same
canonical model.

A single-page electrical PDF can be imported before architectural registration.
Its PDF points are converted to metres in a dedicated page-local canonical
frame, and entity attributes mark that geometry as
`single-page-local-unregistered`. The source-page `z=0` plane is not a
claimed mounting elevation. Mounting height, when stated by the plan, is
preserved separately in `attributes.pdf_electrical.mounting_height_m`.

A multi-page PDF requires an explicit `PdfPageTransform` for every page before
canonical objects are emitted. Every transform must target the same canonical
`frame_id`. If those transforms are missing, incomplete, or target different
frames, import fails rather than creating falsely coincident geometry.
Architectural convergence can supply those transforms once sheet registration
is known. `level_id`, `space_id`, and `host_id` remain null until real
canonical hosts are identified.

## Ambiguity rules

The importer does not create a circuit unless the same text evidence identifies
a source panel, circuit number, and at least one independently recognized load
tag. A circuit callout that merely mentions a panel or device does not
materialize that object at the callout position. Incomplete circuit evidence is
retained under `model.attributes.pdf_electrical.unresolved_circuits`. Repeated
callouts for the same semantic source panel and circuit number are merged into
one canonical circuit. Their load ports and provenance are unioned
deterministically, and conflicting scalar electrical evidence is preserved as
explicit ambiguity instead of being selected by extraction order.

A symbol is materialized only when the symbol catalog yields one clear
classification and the importer also has stable semantic or native identity.
Unknown or tied classifications are retained under `unresolved_observations`,
including the candidate types and confidences. Recognized symbols without stable
identity are also retained there rather than receiving counter-derived
canonical IDs.

Host words such as `WALL MTD` are hints only. They never become a canonical
`host_id` without a real canonical host object.

## Stable identity

`import_pdf(..., source_id=...)` should receive a stable document identity when
one is available. Canonical electrical entity IDs are derived from stable
semantic tags or stable source-native identifiers, never extraction order,
text counters, graphics-operator counters, or mutable coordinates. Counter-based
source element IDs remain useful provenance only.

A recognized graphical symbol that has neither a stable semantic tag nor a
stable native identifier remains unresolved instead of receiving an unstable
canonical ID. When a stable native annotation identifier is present, it can be
used as the identity key.

If no source ID is supplied, the extractor uses a SHA-256 identity for the exact
PDF bytes. That guarantees repeatability for an unchanged file but intentionally
treats a revised PDF as a new source version. Callers that need identity to
survive unrelated PDF revisions must provide the same stable `source_id`.

## Symbol recognition

The built-in catalog recognizes common semantic names in form XObject names and
stamp metadata. It intentionally treats a bare `SW` as ambiguous. Projects with
different CAD export names can pass their own `SymbolRule` sequence without
changing the canonical model contract.

## API

`extract_pdf(path)` produces deterministic source observations from text,
form XObjects, and supported PDF annotations.

`ElectricalPdfImporter.import_document(document, page_transforms=...)`
recognizes an extracted document and returns a canonical `BuildingModel`.
Multi-page documents require transforms for every page.

`ElectricalPdfImporter.import_pdf(path, page_transforms=...)` performs both
steps.

The checked-in fixtures under `fixtures/pdf_electrical/` are synthetic and
contain no customer plan data.
